URL: https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1814

This issue is to make sure that the font size keywords (SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE) can be used to make it easier to create text among the 5 different backends. There are 5 architectures supported: Android, IOS, Windows, Cocoa, and GTK. 

Scope (functionality and code affected).

## Requirements for the new feature or requirements affected by functionality being refactored

Requirement 1: The system should allow keywords for specifying font sizes in Android
Requirement 2: There should be testing for Android font size keywords
Requirement 3: Allow keywords for specifying font sizes in Cocoa
Requirement 4: There should be testing for Cocoa font size keywords
Requirement 5: Allow keywords for specifying font sizes in GTK
Requirement 6: There should be testing for GTK font size keywords
Requirement 7: Allow keywords for specifying font sizes in iOS
Requirement 8: There should be testing for IOS font size keywords
Requirement 9: Allow keywords for specifying font sizes in Windows
